# CSC207-Project-Group-262
## Problem Domain: HR System
Our Team is currently looking to develop a software that alleviates the hassle of maintaining Human Resource system within the administrative body of the University of Toronto.

## Description of Application
- Access to a calendar which shows which roles are missing from lectures and labs.
- Request for leave button that notifies others with the same role (Prof, TA) and asks if there is anyone willing to fill for them by sending it to an announcements page.
- A feature which allows the user to see whether a particular day is a public holiday, for which leaves would not be necessary.
